# Incubyte
🔹Overview:
This repository made to demonstrate implementation of given assessment.Also, a dummy database has been created to demonstarte a simple data flow in different formats from server to the local system, using country-based row filteration. For demonstrating working of data pipeline different tools are used which are listed below

🔸Concepts:
*Data processing
ETL

🔸Tools & Technologies:
* Python
* MySQL Workbench
* Spyder
* Pandas
* MySQL connector

🔹Working:
*step 1: Firstly MySQL database has been created with specified schema.
*step 2: incubyte.py python script, reading sample text file
*step 3: connecting mysql server
*step 4: iterating throught read data and storing it in mysql database
*step 5: The retrieved data is fitted into pandas dataframe for further table manipulation.
*step 6: get_data() & store_file() functions are called to fetch the desired data rows and generating .csv and string file formats to specified path, accepting country names as parameters for filtering rows.
For example: get_file("IND") generates IND.csv to the specified local path. CLick here to see sample output files.
*step 7: git push and commit is done by using GitBash.

*To install mysql.connector:
pip install mysql.connector
*To install pandas:
pip install pandas
